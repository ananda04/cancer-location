Coherent X-ray imaging is a technique utilizing X-ray diffraction to develop images of biological and non-biological substances and has wide applications in medical and non-medical physics. X-ray diffraction is able to identify materials at the molecular structural level and can aid medical diagnosis. In this study, we used Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), Machine Learning, Abundace Estimation, Anomaly detection, and Image Segmentation Algorithms along with X-ray diffraction data to try and find relevant information regarding brain tumor location. The goal of this project is to be able to automate cancer identification by using dimension-reducing softwares and Machine learning algorithm to create an easier workflow for pathologist.
